# FPGA-Implementation-of-I2C-Protocol
This project implements the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol using Verilog on the Microsemi SmartFusion2 M2S050 FPGA. The design was created and tested using the Libero SoC Design Suite. The I2C module was verified by interfacing it with a GMC counter, and the results were analyzed on a digital oscilloscope.
