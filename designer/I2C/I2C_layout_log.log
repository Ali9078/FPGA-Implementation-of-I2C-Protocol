Info: No timing constraint has been associated to the 'Place and Route' tool. 'Place and Route' will be run in non Timing Driven mode.
INFO: The option "Abort flow if errors are found in PDC" is turned ON in Project Settings> Design flow page. The Place & Route tool will fail if errors are found in associated PDC files. Please uncheck the option to ignore the errors and continue running the tool
